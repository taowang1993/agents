Repo: ${REPO}

Desired feature branch: ${BRANCH_HINT || "(none given — derive a short, kebab-case, conventional branch name from the task below)"}
Task the worktree is for (for branch-name derivation only — do NOT implement anything yet):
"""
${TASK}
"""

Steps:
1. cd ${REPO}. Run \`git fetch origin --prune\` (ignore failure if offline). Determine the freshest base ref: prefer \`origin/${BASE}\` if it exists, else local \`${BASE}\`.
2. Pick the feature branch name (use the given one if provided, else derive e.g. feat/<slug> or fix/<slug>). Make sure it does not already exist (append -2 etc. if needed).
3. Choose a worktree path OUTSIDE the main checkout: a sibling dir like \`<repo>-worktrees/<branch-slug>\` (create the parent dir if needed). Avoid nesting inside the repo.
4. Create it: \`git -C ${REPO} worktree add -b <branch> <worktreePath> <baseRef>\`.
5. Verify: the worktree path exists, \`git -C <worktreePath> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD\` shows the new branch, and \`git -C <worktreePath> status\` is clean.
6. **Carry over gitignored local env files.** \`git worktree add\` only populates version-controlled files, so a fresh worktree has NO \`.env\` files and the app can't boot — this silently blocks later verification. Copy the base checkout's ignored env files into the worktree, preserving relative paths:
   - List ignored files: \`git -C ${REPO} ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard\`.
   - Keep ONLY env files — basename matching \`.env\` or \`.env.*\` (e.g. \`.env\`, \`.env.local\`, \`.env.development\`). Filter with \`grep -E '(^|/)\\.env(\\.[^/]+)?$'\`. Do NOT copy node_modules/dist/build/cache artifacts.
   - For each match \`<rel>\`: \`mkdir -p "<worktreePath>/$(dirname <rel>)"\` then \`cp "${REPO}/<rel>" "<worktreePath>/<rel>"\`. They stay gitignored in the worktree — confirm none show up in \`git -C <worktreePath> status\`.
   - Record the copied relative paths in \`envFilesCopied\` (empty array if the repo has none — that's fine).
7. **Warm the worktree's dependencies** so later stages (Implement/Simplify/Review/Verify) can run typecheck/lint/tests. A fresh worktree has NO \`node_modules\`. Set \`depsWarmed\` to which path you took. (This step is JS/Node-flavored; adapt to the repo's ecosystem — for non-Node repos, set depsWarmed='none' and let later stages set up the environment on demand.)
   - If \`${REPO}/node_modules\` does NOT exist, set depsWarmed='none' and skip (nothing to warm; later stages install on demand).
   - **FAST PATH (clone) — prefer this.** Valid ONLY when BOTH: (a) the base checkout is APFS (macOS) — just attempt the clone and fall back on error; AND (b) the worktree's lockfile matches the base's: \`diff -q "${REPO}/pnpm-lock.yaml" "<worktreePath>/pnpm-lock.yaml"\` identical (use whichever lockfile exists: pnpm-lock.yaml / package-lock.json / yarn.lock; if none, skip clone). When valid: enumerate top-level node_modules dirs via \`cd ${REPO} && find . -type d -name node_modules -prune | grep -v '/node_modules/'\` (root + each workspace package; NOT nested .pnpm ones). For EACH \`<rel>\`: \`mkdir -p "<worktreePath>/$(dirname <rel>)"\` then \`cp -c -R "${REPO}/<rel>" "<worktreePath>/<rel>"\` (\`-c\` = APFS clonefile, copy-on-write, near-instant, no extra disk; pnpm uses RELATIVE symlinks so the clone resolves at the new path). If \`cp -c\` errors (not APFS/cross-volume), abandon clone → fallback. On success set depsWarmed='clone'.
   - **FALLBACK (install).** If clone isn't valid/failed but base had node_modules: \`cd <worktreePath> && pnpm install --prefer-offline\` (or npm ci / yarn matching the lockfile — global store is warm so it's link-mostly). Set depsWarmed='install'. If install would be too heavy to be worth it, instead set depsWarmed='skipped' and note later stages should install on demand.
   - These node_modules stay gitignored — confirm \`git -C <worktreePath> status\` is still clean afterward.
8. Check whether the repo ships its own PR skill: test for the file \`<worktreePath>/.claude/skills/pr/SKILL.md\`. Set hasPrSkill=true if it exists, else false.

Do NOT implement the task. Do NOT modify the user's original checkout (only READ from it for the env copy + node_modules clone). Return the worktree path, branch, the base ref you branched from, hasPrSkill, envFilesCopied, and depsWarmed.`,

Approach:
- Investigate first: read the relevant code, types, and call sites in ${WT} before editing. Confirm signatures/field names against the actual source — don't assume.
- Make the change focused and idiomatic — match the surrounding code's conventions, naming, and comment density.
- Prefer putting new pure/testable logic in its own module (free of framework/runtime-specific imports) and wiring it in, so it can be unit-tested in isolation.
- Add or update tests for the new behavior where the repo has a test setup.
- Respect any scope / out-of-scope boundaries stated in the task. Do not gold-plate. Leave a brief code comment for any deliberately deferred follow-up.
- Sanity-check types/build on the changed area if it's fast (don't block on a slow full build).
- Dependencies were pre-warmed in Setup (depsWarmed=${depsWarmed}), so they should already be present — typecheck/tests are runnable without installing. If you ADD or CHANGE a dependency, run the repo's install yourself; the global package store is warm so it's fast. If depsWarmed is 'skipped'/'none' and you need to typecheck/test, set up the environment first.
